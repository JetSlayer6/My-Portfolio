    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <h3>My name is Munachiso Egemole. I am 12 years old, and a member of the Dr. Soyemi TechStar Hub. I am proud to say that this hub has helped me learn a lot of things.</h3>
    <h2>Skills:
        Due to the TechStar Hub, I have learned languages, such as:
        <ol>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ol>
    I have also learned an important aspect of life, called teamwork. This is a very important thing, as when I am having problems with my code, my guardian; Mr. Emmanuel has helped me along the way.
    Projects:
        I have made multiple projects, such as:
        <ol>
            <li>Python Hangman Project</li>

            <li>OS Concept</li>	
    I also made a company called The UG (UnderDog) Company, with my friend and classmate, Abuachi Uzoma. I am also planning on making an electronics company, called The Arctic Wolf Technologies. I will propose the concept to Uzoma, to see how it goes.
